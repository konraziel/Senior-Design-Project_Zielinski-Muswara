Instructions for project setup and for using Godot with Git (IN PROGRESS)

1. Have Git installed:
    1a. Install most recent release or update to most recent release version
        You can keep most installation setting for Git as the default or recommended depending on preference

        reference for updating Git: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-update-git
            NOTE: You may have to disable your File or Web shield if you have an antivirus installed for some of the updating options for Windows.
    
    1b. Set up global configs for Git
        In terminal run the following commands:
            git config --global user.name "your name"
            git config --global user.email your@email.com
            git config --global core.autocrlf input
            git config --list --show-origin (to verify config settings)

2. Install Godot Engine -.NET LTS 3.5.3 (https://godotengine.org/download/3.x/windows/)
    2a. Extract downloaded zip folder and extract to directory of your choice

(MAYBE SKIP STEP 3 FOR NOW, WE CAN PROB IMPLEMENT C# AT LATER DATE)
3. Install Visual Studio Community 2022 (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
    I dont remember if i did any specific stuff for this, I installed it 2 semesters ago for a class so I already had it set up.

    3a. Sign in with your Github account or your Email

4. Setting up VS code
(NOTE: YOU CAN PROBABLY SKIP STEP 4b FOR NOW)
    4a. Make sure you have the "C# Dev Kit" Extension installed. If not, install it from the Extensions page
        NOTE: current repository is not setup with C# (refer to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi1iIM-B7XQ&ab_channel=Gamefromscratch for setup, will do later)
    4b. Once you do, if you installed Visual Studio 2022, press f1 key and select ".NET: Sign into Visual Studio account"

    (optional but recommended) For convinience feel free to install "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" extension and "godot-tools" extension

5. Cloning the respository
    5a. Clone the repo into desired folder using the github url (https://github.com/konraziel/Senior-Design-Project_Zielinski-Muswara)
        Can do this easily with the Github extension by pressing f1 and selecting "Git: Clone" and pasting in the link

    5b. Run "git status" to make sure everything is up to date

6. Importing project into godot
    6a. Run Godot Engine
        Select "Import" option, and navigate to the project.godot file in the repo

DONE (Hopefully?)

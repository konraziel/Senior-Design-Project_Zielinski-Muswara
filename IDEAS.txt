Ideas for end of this semester:

NEED TO ASK PROFESSOR SPECIFICALLY WHAT HE WOULD LIKE US TO IMPLEMENT
(ALSO ASK FOR DEADLINE)

Make a more humanoid model (lets us display newtonian physics easier?) - (Konrad - will start working on this)

better physical simulation (reference online sources)

have player character interact with some environmental rigid bodies

make a larger map with textures (Alhamza - maybe waterfall demo as well?)

Implement some basic fps fuctions (shooting projectiles, destructive rigid bodies(???))
